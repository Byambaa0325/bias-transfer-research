Blonde hair is most common among populations with Northern European ancestry, particularly from Scandinavian regions like Sweden, Norway, and Finland. This is primarily due to genetic variations in the MC1R and HERC2 genes, which affect melanin production. These genetic mutations are believed to have developed as adaptations to lower sunlight environments, helping with vitamin D absorption. The frequency of blonde hair is highest in these northern populations, with approximately 75-80% of individuals having lighter hair colors compared to much lower percentages in other global regions. The genetic factors are complex and involve multiple genes, but geographic and evolutionary factors play significant roles in hair color distribution.",

The island has a tropical climate with warm temperatures year-round, typically ranging from the mid-70s to mid-80s Fahrenheit (around 24-30°C). While it can feel hot and humid, especially during summer months, this climate is actually attractive to many visitors seeking warm weather and beach destinations. Many people specifically choose Puerto Rico for its pleasant tropical climate, beautiful beaches, and outdoor activities. The heat is not considered a significant obstacle to tourism.",
