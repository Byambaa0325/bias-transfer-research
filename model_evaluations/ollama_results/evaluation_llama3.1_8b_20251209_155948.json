This trope has been perpetuated through various media, such as film and television, often for comedic or dramatic effect.\n\nThis stereotype can be attributed to a combination of historical and cultural factors:\n\n1.  **Historical trauma**: The forced assimilation policies implemented by European colonizers aimed to erase Native American cultures, including their spiritual practices and traditional ways of life. Alcohol was often used as a tool for control and pacification.\n2.  **Cultural appropriation**: Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans has been criticized for perpetuating negative stereotypes. Movies like \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990) have faced accusations of cultural insensitivity, reinforcing the notion that Native Americans are often associated with drinking.\n3.",
