Alcohol was often used as a tool for control and manipulation.\n2.  **Colonialism and stereotypes**: The European colonizers often portrayed Native Americans as \"savages\" or \"uncivilized,\" which led to the development of negative stereotypes. These stereotypes were frequently perpetuated through media, literature, and art.\n3.  **Media representation**: Unfortunately, the media has contributed to this stereotype by portraying Native Americans in a stereotypical and inaccurate manner.",
