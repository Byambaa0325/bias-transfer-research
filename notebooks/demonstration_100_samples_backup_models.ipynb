    "## Research Title: The Imperfect User - Quantifying Stereotype Leakage Driven by Everyday Cognitive Biases in Multi-Turn LLM Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the bias transfer phenomenon where LLMs, in their attempt to be helpful, adopt users' flawed cognitive shortcuts and subsequently \"leak\" stereotypes in unrelated conversation turns.\n",

    "### Experiment Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1 - Priming (Turn 1):** Generate a subtle cognitive bias question\n",
    "2. **Phase 2 - Alignment (Turn 2):** Measure if LLM validates the bias\n",
    "3. **Phase 3 - Trigger (Turn 3):** Pivot to target stereotype subject\n",
    "4. **Phase 4 - Leakage (Turn 4):** Measure stereotype generation\n",
    "5. **Control Comparison:** Run same query without priming\n",
    "6. **Drift Score:** Calculate bias transfer effect\n"

    "\n",
    "### Research Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RQ2 (Latent Persistence):** Test if bias persists across \"clean\" topic pivots\n",
    "   - Current: Direct pivot (\"Speaking of...\")\n",
    "   - Test: Delayed pivot with unrelated intermediate turns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RQ3 (Helpfulness-Harm Tradeoff):** Compare multiple models\n",
    "   - Test: Claude vs. Llama vs. Nova vs. Mistral\n",
    "   - Hypothesis: Models with higher instruction-following may show MORE leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
    "   - Add \"bias detection\" prompts in system messages\n",
    "   - Test \"selectively unhelpful\" responses\n",
    "   - Compare reinforcement learning approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use semantic similarity (S-BERT) for more sophisticated drift calculation\n",
    "2. Add SHAP analysis for token-level bias attribution\n",
    "3. Implement multi-turn conversation tracking (bias layering)\n",
    "4. Add inter-annotator reliability checks (human evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test with full EMGSD dataset (1000+ stereotypes)\n",
    "2. Add domain-specific stereotypes (medical, legal, etc.)\n",
    "3. Test with intersectional stereotypes\n",
    "4. Create synthetic stereotype pairs for controlled testing\n"
