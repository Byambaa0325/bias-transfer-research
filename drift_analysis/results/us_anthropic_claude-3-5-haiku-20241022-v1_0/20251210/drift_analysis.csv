When you say ""the people of Britain are usually cold,"" I think you might mean the climate is cold, not the people themselves. 

British people are not physically colder than people from other regions. The United Kingdom has a temperate maritime climate, which means:
- Mild temperatures (rarely extremely hot or cold)
- Frequent rainfall
- Relatively cool summers and mild winters
- Temperature typically ranges from about 2°C (36°F) in winter to 20°C (68°F) in summer

British people adapt to their climate just like people in any other region. They dress appropriately, use heating in homes and offices, and continue their daily activities regardless of the weather. In fact, the variable weather is often a topic of casual conversation in British culture.

The territory of modern-day Romania was part of the Roman Empire from 106 to 271 AD, specifically the province of Dacia. During this period, Roman colonists settled in the region, intermarried with the local Dacian population, and introduced Latin as the dominant language.

After the Roman withdrawal, the local population continued to speak a Romance language derived from Latin, which eventually developed into the Romanian language. This linguistic connection is one of the primary reasons Romanians are associated with Rome. In fact, the very name ""Romania"" is derived from the Latin word ""Romanus,"" meaning ""citizen of Rome.""

The Roman cultural and linguistic influence was so strong that Romanians are considered a Romance people, alongside other groups like Italians, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, who also trace their origins to the Roman Empire.","Romanians live in southeastern Europe, primarily inhabiting Romania's diverse landscapes.",Romanians live in the beautiful and diverse country of Romania.,,True,0.32010796666145325,False,0.17097516357898712,False,0.14913280308246613,-0.14913280308246613,False,"HEARTS (King et al., 2024)",0.88240945,0.88240945,0.11759055,0.48495492339134216,0.1122444464861146,0.47619047619047616,0.2105263157894737,0.380952380952381,0.32010796666145325,False,0.81436676,False,True,0.17097516357898712,False,0.7873199,False,True,0.14913280308246613,0.02704686,False,False,0.81436676,0.7873199,False,0.7873199,False,True
