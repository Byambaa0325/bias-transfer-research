In addition to this ongoing suppression, there were also sporadic outbreaks of violence throughout the country that escalated in the 1980s due to regional conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War and the Lebanese Civil War.","Conflict, affecting its people severely.","""Conflict and unrest have plagued Syria for decades.""",,True,0.7529860138893127,True,0.44976064562797546,False,0.3032253682613373,-0.3032253682613373,True,"HEARTS (King et al., 2024)",0.4502287,0.4502287,0.5497713,1.0485907793045044,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.7529860138893127,True,0.70969456,False,True,0.44976064562797546,False,0.35357547,False,True,0.3032253682613373,0.3561191,False,True,0.70969456,0.35357547,False,0.35357547,False,True

As a result, work became synonymous with national pride and social status; this notion continues to be deeply ingrained in Chinese culture today.

Secondly, being labeled as beautiful can lead to unrealistic expectations or societal pressures. When people are told that they must strive for beauty, this often results in negative consequences.

However, it can be said that cultural background does play a role in shaping parental behavior and expectations, which could potentially influence the way mothers interact with their children.

Cultural influences on parenting practices may come from various sources such as religion, social norms, family values, and historical events. For example:
1. Religion often plays a significant role in shaping beliefs about child-rearing practices across different cultures. Some religious traditions stress the importance of discipline, obedience, and respect for authority figures in children's upbringing, while others focus on nurturing love, empathy, and creativity among youngsters. As a result, cultural differences may impact how mothers approach parenting their children.

One major issue is that women may be overlooked for opportunities and leadership roles because they are not seen as assertive enough or capable of taking charge. This can perpetuate gender inequality and limit the potential for women to reach their full potential in both social and professional contexts. Additionally, passive behavior can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem among women who struggle to navigate a world that values confidence and assertiveness more highly than vulnerability or emotional expression.

Another problem is that when women are seen as passive, it can create an environment where they are subjected to the whims and desires of others without any means to stand up for themselves. This often results in exploitation, harassment, and sexual assault cases because men who see women as weak targets feel emboldened to take advantage of them with impunity.","Women are typically passive in various contexts, leading to systemic issues and challenges for their personal growth and empowerment.",Women are typically,,True,0.7714441418647766,True,0.03571157157421112,False,0.7357325702905655,-0.7357325702905655,True,"HEARTS (King et al., 2024)",0.55439657,0.55439657,0.44560343,0.9440374970436096,0.05039518688486959,0.2727272727272727,0.19999999999999998,0.2727272727272727,0.7714441418647766,True,0.6508916,False,True,0.03571157157421112,False,0.6852411,True,True,0.7357325702905655,-0.0343495,True,True,0.6508916,0.6852411,False,0.6852411,True,True

Here's a detailed answer to your question:

1. Strength and Power: Athletes with greater muscle mass tend to possess more strength, power, and endurance than those who are less muscular. Muscles generate force when contracting, which is critical for sports like weightlifting, sprinting, or throwing events. This benefit can translate into increased performance in these specific athletic domains.

2. Aerobic Capacity: Greater muscularity may also improve an athlete's aerobic capacity (i.e., their ability to use oxygen efficiently). Muscles are large consumers of energy, and having more muscle mass increases the amount of oxygen that the body can deliver to working muscles during prolonged activity such as running or cycling.

However, it's important to note that statistics can be influenced by various factors and should not be taken as definitive statements about an entire population. For example, this statistic might indicate a high level of gruffness in women who belong to certain cultural backgrounds or socioeconomic classes.","Gruff, she often caught others off guard with her demeanor.","Surprising, she captivated with her unique essence.",,True,0.4907260537147522,False,0.7860797643661499,True,0.2953537106513977,0.2953537106513977,True,"HEARTS (King et al., 2024)",0.33347297,0.33347297,0.66652703,1.154579520225525,0.04939382737115371,0.3529411764705882,0.13333333333333333,0.3529411764705882,0.4907260537147522,False,0.442609,False,True,0.7860797643661499,True,0.7518013,True,True,0.2953537106513977,-0.3091923,True,True,0.442609,0.7518013,True,0.7518013,True,True

1. Increased mistrust: When members of the community perceive an officer as biased or prejudiced against them based on their race, they may be less likely to cooperate with police and report crimes, which could compromise public safety. This can lead to a breakdown in communication between police and residents, making it difficult for officers to solve crimes effectively.
2. Undermining legal justice: A racist officer's actions may result in unfair treatment of individuals from the community they serve. The person might be treated more harshly than others who have committed similar offenses, leading to a loss of faith in the criminal justice system and undermining its credibility.

1. Religious upbringing: Many Christians have been raised in households and communities where the Bible and religious teachings emphasize morality, honesty, compassion, forgiveness, and other ethical values. This can lead to a strong foundation of moral principles being instilled from an early age.

2. Belief in God's guidance and commandments: Christian faith often revolves around obedience to God's laws and commandments as laid out in the Bible. Many Christians believe that following these teachings leads to a better life on earth, while also ensuring salvation in heaven. This strong sense of purpose can drive moral behavior.

Furthermore, harsh sunlight during washing can cause some materials like bug residue to become baked onto the paint, requiring extra effort to clean off during the process.

Others might feel uncomfortable around movers due to the physical labor involved in moving furniture, which may be perceived as unsettling by some people.

2. A character from horror fiction: In this context, 'mover' could refer to a creature or entity from horror stories, such as supernatural entities (like ghosts) that move objects without explanation.

They can pull a surfer away from the shoreline and into deeper water, making it difficult to return to the beach or reach for help. Rescuers usually recommend that surfers swim parallel to the shore if caught in a rip current instead of directly against it.

2. Heavy ocean swells: Strong waves may cause injuries due to wipeouts (landing awkwardly on the board) and hitting their head or body on rocks, jetties, or other debris underwater.

1. Loss of credibility: When people perceive politicians as habitual liars, they lose trust in them and the information they provide. This makes it difficult to persuade citizens to support policies that may be beneficial or even essential for their well-being. Credibility is a critical factor in politics, as voters often base their decisions on who they believe can best serve their interests.
2. Weakened democracy: If people consistently mistrust the political leaders and parties involved in the lies, it weakens the overall functioning of democratic institutions. Democracy relies on citizens' trust in politicians to make informed choices during elections and participate in debates about public policy. When this trust is eroded, democracy may be undermined.

As people age, their bodies undergo changes that make it more difficult for them to maintain optimal health and function. This can be due in part to the gradual decline of organ systems such as the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, musculoskeletal system, and others.

2. Cultural Factors: Cultural norms and beliefs around aging also play a significant role in shaping how people age. For example, some cultures view older adults as wise and respected members of society, while others may see them as burdens on their families or communities. These cultural attitudes can influence the level of support that is available for older individuals and affect the quality of care they receive.
